# Udacity-SuperDuo - Jim Howard

Note: These projects were initialized with the Udacity-SuperDuo-StarterKit by Brad Erickson (Udacity student eosrei). Brad did some project  cleanup and updated the projects for SDK 22 and Gradle 1.3.  No actual content was added to the original Udacity starting projects.

See https://github.com/eosrei/Udacity-SuperDuo-StarterKit for details.

The api key for the Football database should be saved in 
FootballScores\app\src\main\res\values\strings_api.xml

Debug builds of the Football app will include Dummy League data.
